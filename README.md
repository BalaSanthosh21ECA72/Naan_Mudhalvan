# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data over multiple years. The dataset provided contains valuable information about product sales for each month of every year. The project aims to gain insights, spot trends, and make data-driven decisions based on the analysis of this data.

## Project Phases

This project is divided into several phases, and each phase contributes to our final goal of gaining insights from the data. Here's an overview of the project phases:

1. ###Phase 3: Development Part 1 - Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset**: In this phase, we loaded the dataset, checked for errors, and preprocessed the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability. We have now prepared a clean dataset for further analysis.

2. ###Phase 4: Development Part 2 - In this part we will continue building our project. Continue building the analysis by creating visualizations using IBM Cognos and generating actionable insights. Use IBM Cognos to design interactive dashboards and reports that display insights such as top-selling products, sales trends, and customer preferences. Derive insights from the visualizations, such as identifying products with the highest sales, peak sales periods, and customer preferences for specific products.
